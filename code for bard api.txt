Here is another task in this task we were bound to make a function for parsing purpose and make a class that handle Singleton pattern.
Here is the code that is write:
# simple code to get response of bard in our terminal
from bardapi import Bard

api_key = "YAisNK8snD2F-uJIX7LEpXTIvC1QlaWU1V--UyZAj-PVqMHRXvpAPv1qUHaJkCrlMaV5wA."
token = api_key
bard = Bard(token=token)

response = bard.get_answer("how to make epc to bpmn converter?")
print(response['content'])


# with adding function
from bardapi import Bard

def get_bard_response(question):
    api_key = "YAisNK8snD2F-uJIX7LEpXTIvC1QlaWU1V--UyZAj-PVqMHRXvpAPv1qUHaJkCrlMaV5wA."
    token = api_key
    bard = Bard(token=token)
    response = bard.get_answer(question)
    return response['content']

question = "how to make epc to bpmn converter?"
response = get_bard_response(question)
print(response)


# with just adding class
from bardapi import Bard

class BardAPI:
    def __init__(self, token):
        self.bard = Bard(token=token)

    def get_response(self, question):
        response = self.bard.get_answer(question)
        return response['content']

api_key = "YAisNK8snD2F-uJIX7LEpXTIvC1QlaWU1V--UyZAj-PVqMHRXvpAPv1qUHaJkCrlMaV5wA."
token = api_key

bard_api = BardAPI(token)
question = "how to make epc to bpmn converter?"
response = bard_api.get_response(question)
print(response)



# arranging class in Singleton Pattern
from bardapi import Bard

class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, token):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        cls._instance.bard = Bard(token=token)
        return cls._instance

    def request_bard(self, question):
        response = self.bard.get_answer(question)
        return response['content']

api_key = "YAisNK8snD2F-uJIX7LEpXTIvC1QlaWU1V--UyZAj-PVqMHRXvpAPv1qUHaJkCrlMaV5wA."
token = api_key

bard_api = Singleton(token)
question = "what is bard?"
response = bard_api.request_bard(question)
print(response)



In our output we got response of bard in our terminal and the concept of Singleton was to create only one object.
